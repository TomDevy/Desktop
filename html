        From time immemorial, men from different walks, races, and cultures have used words as a tool to communicate feelings. 
      </p>
      
        <p>One of the major tools they employed in achieving this goal was poetry. Poetry can be fun, yes... But much more than fun, you get to lay your heart bare in Poetry.

    <article>
      <p>
       In writing good poetry, Observation id important. A poet must be observant. Observe feelings. Observe nature. Observe people. Observe events. Observe experiences. Observe all. 
      </p>
      <P>
        If you do not observe and understand things, how can you evoke feelings about those things in others?
        <code>
          A good Poet is one who observes well. He notices the seemingly unnoticeable. He smells. He hears. He feels. He observes, not just with the eyes, but with all the sense organs.

    <p>
      It is all about expression. Expression is not just about speaking or writing words. In expression, you are being yourself;pouring out your heart, staying true to your thoughts;letting yourself lose on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renowned poet, R.S. Thomas, said this about poetry:
      <code>
        Poetry is that which arrives at the intellect by way of the heart

    <p>
      The Poet is a thinker. To think is to meditate, to ponder;to consider;to reflect pon things, external or inrternal. 
    </p>
    <code>Observation is the key to the room of reflection.
    </code>
    <p>
      I like to think that reflection involves RETROSPECTION.

  <header>Introspection & Retrospection</header>
  <article>
    <p>
      According to the English Dictionary, introspection, also referred to as "inlook",simply means "a looking forward;specifically, the act or process of self-examination, or inspection of one's own thoughts and feelings."
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, Introspection means thinking about things that happen to no one. It's a self-evaluation of one's experiences and actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Retrospection is the deliberate recall of past events. This simply means thinking about experiences that occured in the past.

      All that we have said hitherto brings us to IMAGERY. A good poem is one layered with good and relatable imagery. The word "imagery" implies 'descrition'. As the name implies, imagery means that you are creating images, pictures, events and experiences in the hearts of people. It's a serious business. Without the use of imagery, it becomes difficult to make your readers feel.
      <code>
        A Poem is nothing without Imagery.
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at these two examples below:
      <code>
        The moment was as dark as the sun.
        The boy was heavy as a feather.
      </code>
      Tell me what might be wrong with these examples?
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem is this: the imageries are untrue!
      This kind of creativity is so wrong. The imageries evoke conflicting images. You don't want that for your readers. You deny the words their trueness when you do this. A good Poem is a true one. I don't mean true in the sense that it happened to you. I mean true in the context of your words and imagery.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this is what I mean by "your imageries must be relatable". In other words,they are true. They are related.
      <code>
        The moment was as dark as the night.
        The boy was as light as a feather.
      </code>
      This is simple, yet true. It evokes feelings about past and present.

  <p>
    Now, to the Almighty question: must I rhyme in my poetry?
    There's a widely held but totally unfounded belief that poetry has to rhyme, or it's not poetry. This enables the unonformed to dismiss much modern poetry as some kind of aberration. Yet rhyme has NEVER BEEN THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF POETRY(emphasis mine). But when you look at the kind of books used in schools over the past hundred years,you begin to see how their narrowness has helped make people's knowledge of poetry so oddly selective.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ESSENCE OF POETRY HAS ALWAYS BEEN RHYTHM--NOT RHYME--(emphasis mine) and in many languages rhyme isn't used at all.
    It is for the poet to choose whether or not rhyme is appropriate in each particular poem. But if you write traditional rhyming verse, you also have to follow a rhythmical pattern, the meter.
  </p>
  <code>
    Bottom line, rhyming is not compulsory at all.

    <p>
      Grammar deals with sentences,spellings,and the general syntax of sentences. One of the major issues one must pay attention to in poetry is the tense that is used. We can't use past tense where present tense is supposed to be used.
      <code>
        For example, you can't say:
        What did he said? The right thing to say is 'What did he say?'
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're using modal verbs such as "would, should, could", then follow that with a past participle.
      <code>
        As in:
        She would have gone...
        He could have done it...
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as much as you're supposed to write from the heart, you must pay attention to your grammar. One way to avoid grammar errors in your poems is to read your poems first. When you read your poems,it helps you to edit them.
